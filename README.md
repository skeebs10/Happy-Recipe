# Happy Recipe

My goal is to create an app where you can search by ingredient to find a recipe you can make at home. Often times you have ingredients laying around your home with no idea what to make. This app is helpful in providing direction for a healthy, cost effective alternative to eating out. Save money while staying entertained!

I work in a food/houswares company and thought this app would be a fun way to showcase and explore my passion for culinary. Create a recipe and publish it on the website! This plaftorm can help any cook share their work of art with the world and can be a fun way to connect/network within industry. 

HAPPY RECIPE!

I installedv Material-UI and applied it for the first time! It was fun learning new features and will definitely be using this for my future apps to create the best UX experience.
